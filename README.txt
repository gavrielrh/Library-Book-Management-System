[Description]
The Library Book Management System(LBMS) is the system used by the Book Worm Library(BWL)
to provide book information to users, track library visitor statistics for a library statistics report,
track borrowed out books, and make updates to the libraryâ€™s inventory.
The system will provide an API used by a client-side interface that will be used by a BWL employee.

---------------------------------------------------------

[Setup]
LBMS requires a text file named "books.txt" with a listing of all the possible books for purchasing.

[File Locations]
All .txt files used by LBMS (including books.txt) are located in ./data/

----------------------------------------------------------

[Functional Limitations]
SearchRequests don't return results if all parameters are empty/*;
Books are purchased using their ISBN, rather than temporary ID based on earlier Searches.
Clean shutdowns only occur if the system is exited using the "quit;" request.
Statistics requests don't work for a range of days.
